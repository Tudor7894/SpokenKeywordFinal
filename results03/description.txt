RNN-CTC MODEL
 - starts with batch normalization
 - two CNN layer blocks, convolutions with unit stride and ReLU, and each block followed by MaxPool stride 2
   (1: 1 layer 32 kernels of size 5)
   (2: 1 layer 64 kernels of size 5)
 - two BiLSTM, both with dropout 0.25
   (1: 128 units)
   (2: 128 units)
